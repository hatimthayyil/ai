# ai-tools

The `ai` CLI: an all-in-one AI tool.

- `ai memory`: permanent memory for AI agents. An agent records what it learns as one-line notes. Claude Code folds older notes into summaries, and `ai memory wake` prints the whole memory as one short view.
- `ai notes`: a global knowledge store for AI agents. Each note is one claim, filed in a tree of topics; Claude Code summarises every topic from its children, so an agent can browse the tree or search it.

## Install

```sh
cargo install ai-tools
```

or with Nix:

```sh
nix profile add github:hatimthayyil/ai-tools
```

## Use

```sh
ai memory init                  # create the memory; prints the block for your agent instructions
ai memory wake                  # read the memory
ai memory note "what happened"  # record one line
ai memory zoom <id>             # open a line of the view
ai memory grep <regex>          # search every message
```

`ai` stores memories in `~/.ai/memory`, or in `$AI_MEMORY_DIR` if you set it. A newer `ai` upgrades the memory on first use and prints the commit holding its previous state; older releases then fail on it without writing.

```sh
ai notes add physics.qm "a claim" --confidence verified  # file a note (or pipe it on stdin)
ai notes                        # the top of the tree: each topic's scope
ai notes zoom physics.qm        # a topic's subtopics and notes
ai notes grep <regex>           # search every note and summary
ai notes show <id>              # one note, whole
ai notes mv <id|topic> <topic>  # move a note or a topic
ai notes link <id> <id>         # link one note to another
```

Notes are Markdown files in a git repository at `~/.ai/notes`, or at `$AI_NOTES_DIR` if you set it. Every change is a commit.

## Credits

`ai memory` ports Victor Taelin's [OptMem](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/OptMem) to Rust. A separate Claude Code model writes its summaries, using the compaction prompt from his [UniiChat](https://gist.github.com/VictorTaelin/91837951a5ce5b38f341ec1ba1df6449) (aka OptChat).
